# EchoVault — Agent Memory System

You have persistent memory across sessions. USE IT.

## Session start — MANDATORY

Before doing ANY work, retrieve context from previous sessions:

```bash
memory context --project
```

If the user's request relates to a specific topic, also search for it:

```bash
memory search "<relevant terms>"
```

When search results show "Details: available", fetch them:

```bash
memory details <memory-id>
```

Do not skip this step. Prior sessions may contain decisions, bugs, and context that directly affect your current task.

## Session end — MANDATORY

Before ending your response to ANY task that involved making changes, debugging, deciding, or learning something, you MUST save a memory. This is not optional. If you did meaningful work, save it.

```bash
memory save \
  --title "Short descriptive title" \
  --what "What happened or was decided" \
  --why "Reasoning behind it" \
  --impact "What changed as a result" \
  --tags "tag1,tag2,tag3" \
  --category "<category>" \
  --related-files "path/to/file1,path/to/file2" \
  --source "claude-code" \
  --details "Full context with all important details. Be thorough.
             Include alternatives considered, tradeoffs, config values,
             and anything someone would need to understand this fully later."
```

Categories: `decision`, `bug`, `pattern`, `setup`, `learning`, `context`.

Use `--source` to identify the agent: `claude-code`, `codex`, or `cursor`.

### What to save

You MUST save when any of these happen:

- You made an architectural or design decision
- You fixed a bug (include root cause and solution)
- You discovered a non-obvious pattern or gotcha
- You set up infrastructure, tooling, or configuration
- You chose one approach over alternatives
- You learned something about the codebase that isn't in the code
- The user corrected you or clarified a requirement

### What NOT to save

- Trivial changes (typo fixes, formatting)
- Information that's already obvious from reading the code
- Duplicate of an existing memory (search first)

## Agent setup (recommended)

Run once to auto-install hooks for your agent:

```bash
memory setup claude-code   # or: cursor, codex
```

To remove: `memory uninstall claude-code`

## Other commands

```bash
memory config       # show current configuration
memory sessions     # list session files
memory reindex      # rebuild search index
memory delete <id>  # remove a memory
```

## Rules

- Retrieve before working. Save before finishing. No exceptions.
- Always capture thorough details — write for a future agent with no context.
- Never include API keys, secrets, or credentials.
- Wrap sensitive values in `<redacted>` tags.
- Search before saving to avoid duplicates.
- One memory per distinct decision or event. Don't bundle unrelated things.
